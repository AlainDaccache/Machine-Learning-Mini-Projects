# Machine-Learning-Mini-Projects

Course projects related to Artificial Intelligence (COMP 424), Computer Vision (ECSE 415), and Applied Machine Learning (COMP 551).

## COVID-19 Search Trends and Hospitalization

Analyze, visualize, and compare the performance of k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and time-series analysis in predicting COVID-19 hospitalization cases from related symptoms search, across time and regions in the US.

## Multi-Class Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent

Implement from scratch the Softmax Regression model fitted with a batch gradient descent optimizer, tuning hyperparameters using grid search, and early-stopping capability to avoid overfitting.

## Multi-Label Classification of Image Data

Deep Neural Network trained by automatic differentiation and implemented in PyTorch, to classify image data using a modified MNIST dataset. Reached a 99.4% accuracy.

## Shopping Mall Crowd Counting

Computer Vision algorithm for modeling and analyzing movements of people in a surveillance video of a mall, based on a Support Vector Machine person detection technique.

## Saboteur Game Agent

Implemented from scratch and compared the performance of AI algorithms minimax, alpha-beta, and Monte Carlo Tree Search to develop an AI agent for a variant of the Saboteur board game in Java.
